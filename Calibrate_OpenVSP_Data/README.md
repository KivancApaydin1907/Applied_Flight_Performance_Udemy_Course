# T38-Aerodynamic-Calibration

**A Semi-Empirical System Identification tool that bridges the gap between inviscid Potential Flow (OpenVSP) and experimental flight test data.**

### 🚀 Overview
This project addresses a common challenge in preliminary aircraft design: **High-fidelity data is expensive, but low-fidelity data is optimistic.**

Using the **Northrop T-38 Talon** as a case study, this MATLAB tool ingests linear, inviscid aerodynamic data generated by OpenVSP (Vortex Lattice Method) and calibrates it against real-world wind tunnel data. By identifying the viscous flow separation points ("Stall"), it generates a corrected, high-fidelity **Aerodynamic Response Surface** suitable for 6-DOF flight simulation.

### 📊 Results

#### 1. System Identification (Calibration)
The core algorithm uses `fminsearch` to optimize a quadratic penalty function, fitting the linear OpenVSP model to the experimental viscous reality at Mach 0.4. It automatically detects the **Linearity Shift Point** (Stall Onset).

#### 2. Envelope Extrapolation (The "Digital Twin")
Once the stall physics are identified, the tool extrapolates this behavior across the entire subsonic flight envelope (Mach 0.2 - 0.8), creating a continuous look-up table for the flight simulator.

### 🔧 Methodology

The tool operates on a **Semi-Empirical Correction** logic:

1.  **Inviscid Baseline:** Ingests raw $C_L$ vs $\alpha$ data from OpenVSP.
2.  **Experimental Anchor:** Loads reliable wind tunnel data for a specific reference condition (Mach 0.4).
3.  **Optimization Loop:** Minimizes the error between the model and reality by tuning two variables:
    * $\alpha_{trigger}$: The angle where flow separation begins.
    * $k$: The "sharpness" of the stall curve.
4.  **Correction Function:**
    $$C_{L_{corrected}} = C_{L_{vsp}} - k \cdot (\alpha - \alpha_{trigger})^2$$
    *(Applied only when $\alpha > \alpha_{trigger}$)*
5.  **Database Generation:** Exports a structured `.mat` database containing the corrected surfaces.
